words like violence
break the silence
come crashing in
into my little world

painful to me
pierce right through me
can't you understand
oh my little girl


all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
is here in my arms
words are very
unnecessary
they can only do harm


/////////////////////
vows are spoken
to be broken
feelings are intense
words are trivial

pleasures remain
so does the pain
words are meaningless
and forgettable


all i ever wanted
all i ever needed
is here in my arms
words are very
unnecessary
they can only do harm
